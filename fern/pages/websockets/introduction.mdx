title: WebSocket API
---

The Paradex WebSocket API provides real-time market data and account updates. WebSockets allow for a persistent connection between the client and server, enabling efficient two-way communication.

## Server URLs

| Environment | WebSocket URL |
|-------------|--------------|
| Testnet (Sepolia) | wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1 |
| Mainnet | wss://ws.api.prod.paradex.trade/v1 |

## Public vs Private Channels

The Paradex WebSocket API provides two types of channels:

- **Public Channels**: Publish information about the exchange that is not specific to a particular account. Examples include market summary, order book, trades, etc. You do not need to authenticate to subscribe to public channels.

- **Private Channels**: Publish information about a particular account. You need to authenticate to subscribe to private channels.

## Establishing a Connection

To establish a WebSocket connection, you can use various programming languages and libraries. When running Python-based code, Python 3.10+ is recommended.

### Example in Python

```python
import websocket
import json

websocket_url = "wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1"

# Define a callback to check connection success
def on_open(ws):
    print('Connected')

# Connect to the WebSocket server
ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(websocket_url, on_open=on_open)

# Wait for a response
ws.run_forever()
```

Upon successful connection, you should see:

```
Connected
```

## Maintaining a Connection

Paradex has implemented ping/pong functionality as part of the WebSocket specification. This works at the protocol level:

- The server sends a ping message every 55 seconds
- The client must respond with a pong within 5 seconds
- Upon receiving the pong, the connection is renewed for 60 seconds
- If the server doesn't receive a pong within the 5-second window, the connection is terminated

Most modern WebSocket libraries and frameworks automatically handle ping/pong messages. If you're using older libraries or building a WebSocket client from scratch, you may need to implement this functionality manually.

To display incoming ping messages, you can use the following wscat command:

```bash
wscat -P -w 120 -c wss://ws.api.testnet.paradex.trade/v1 -x '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"subscribe","params":{"channel":"markets_summary"}}' | grep "ping"
```
