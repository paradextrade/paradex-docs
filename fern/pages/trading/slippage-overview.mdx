title: Price Impact and Slippage
---

## What is Price Impact?

Price impact refers to how much the price of an asset moves due to a trader's order consuming liquidity at various price levels in the order book.

### Mechanism
- An orderbook consists of **limit orders** at various prices. The best available price for a buyer is the lowest ask, and for a seller, it's the highest bid.
- When you place a **market order**, it consumes liquidity starting from the best available price and moves deeper into the order book as necessary to fulfill the order.
- The larger the market order, the more price levels it will sweep, leading to a greater price impact.

## What is Slippage?

Slippage is the deviation between the expected price of a trade (based on the top of the orderbook) and the actual average price at which the trade is executed.

### Mechanism
    - Slippage occurs due to **price impact** (trading across multiple price levels in the book) and/or **market conditions** like volatility.
    - The key factors affecting slippage are:
        1. **Order Size**: Larger orders consume more of the orderbook, resulting in more slippage.
        2. **Market Liquidity**: Thin orderbooks with low volume at each price level exacerbate slippage.
        3. **Volatility**: Rapid price changes during execution can lead to unexpected outcomes.

<Accordion title="Example">
| Price Level | Ask Price | Ask Size |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| 1           | 100,000   | 10       |
| 2           | 100,010   | 5        |
| 3           | 100,030   | 10       |

If I submit a market order of size 20, I will get the following fills :

- 10 at a price of 100,000
- 5 at a price of 100,010
- 5 at a price of 100,030

The price impact in this case was $30. 

The average fill price is :

(100,000 * 10 + 100,010 * 5 + 100,030 * 5) / 20 = 100,010

So the slippage relative to best ask price was $10

## How can I minimize my slippage?

- **Limit Orders**:
    - Place [limit orders](./placing-orders/order-types/limit-order) at desired prices to avoid price impact and control slippage.
    - Note: This risks the order not being filled if the market doesn’t reach your limit price.
- **Order Splitting**:
    - Break large orders into smaller chunks and execute them over time to reduce price impact.
    - [TWAP](./placing-orders/order-types/twap-order) (Time-Weighted Average Price) can help to do this in an automated way
- **Use Market Depth**:
    - Analyze the orderbook depth to estimate how much liquidity is available at each price level before placing large orders.
- **Set [Maximum Slippage](./price-impact-and-slippage/slippage)** :
    - Define a maximum acceptable slippage to avoid orders executing at unexpectedly poor prices.
