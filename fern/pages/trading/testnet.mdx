<Accordion title="Why is my wallet asking me about a Sepolia network?">
The Paradex Testnet operates on Ethereum's test network **Sepolia**.
Your wallet may prompt you to switch to the Sepolia network to interact with the Paradex Testnet. 

For more information on Sepolia, check out [this article](https://getblock.medium.com/what-is-sepolia-a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-test-networks-866663a26698)

<Accordion title="How do I manage my funds on testnet?">
By default, each new account is automatically credited with **$1,000,000 of test USDC** shortly after creation.

You can use these just as you would funds in prod except we provide them directly!

**If you run out of test funds:**
- Visit [this page](https://docs.paradex.trade/documentation/accounts/sub-accounts) in our documentation and follow the steps to create a **Sub-Accounts**
   - New sub-accounts are also credited with **$1,000,000 of test USDC** 
- Once the new sub account has been funded, use the **Transfer** feature in the **Portfolio** section to move test USDC from the sub-account to your main account.

> **Note**: Accounts cannot be reset, so creating sub-accounts or onboarding a new wallet is the only way to replenish your test funds for the time being.
